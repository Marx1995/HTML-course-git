# HTML-course-git Development
Youtube HTML course I followed

The problem I was facing was not directly a coding issue but more of a life choice problem.
I did not know what direction of IT I wanted to go into once i was done with my degree and that made me scared that I might be doing the wrong thing.
I then decided to look into different coding areas and tried some courses on them all. I found HTML and web development as whole very interesting and made me realise I was going in the right direction.
Thanks to this course I found my passion for development and I now know what direction I want to go with IT.
